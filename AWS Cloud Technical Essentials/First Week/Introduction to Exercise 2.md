Let's keep the momentum going, shall we? Time for another hands-on exercise. This time, since you already have your AWS account, and you've learned about some of the best practices for securing AWS accounts, let's put those best practices into practice. You'll log into your AWS account with the root user and you'll enable multi-factor authentication. Next, you'll find the root access keys, which provide unlimited access to your AWS resources. As stated in a previous lesson, it's not recommended to use these unrestricted keys in normal situations, so you'll go ahead and delete yours from the account. Then, once that's taken care of, you'll create an IAM user with administrative privileges. Then you'll log out of the root user and log in with the new IAM user. This user will be used to manage your AWS account from this point forward, unless the root user is specifically needed. The first task you'll complete with this new IAM user is you'll create an IAM role with more limited privileges that will come in handy in future exercises. Have fun.
