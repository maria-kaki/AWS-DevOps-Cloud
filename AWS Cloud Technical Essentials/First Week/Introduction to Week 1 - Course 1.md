This is a basic CRUD app or create read, update, delete. This app keeps track of employees within a company. So the first thing I'm going to do is create a new employee. To create an employee, we'll give the employee a name, and I'm going to add myself. So I'll add my name. My location is USA. And then my job title, I'll enter in Cloud Technologist. And then we can add some badges for each employee. This is like an employee's flare, so I'm gonna select Mac User for myself and Photographer, and then I will click Save. Now, I'm back on the homepage, and I actually forgot to add a photo for this employee, so let's go ahead and edit it and add the employee photo. You can also see this app gives me the ability to delete employees from the directory. So, those are the features of the app from a user's perspective. Time to review how we will build this app using AWS services.

This application will be built in a private network using Amazon Virtual Private Cloud or VPC. We will host the application's backend code on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, or EC2, which is a service that essentially offers virtual machines on AWS. So let's go ahead and add those servers to our diagram. The employee data will be stored in a database, which will also live inside this network and will be hosted using a service called Amazon Relational Database Service or RDS. So I'll go ahead and add that to the diagram as well. The images for the employees will be stored using the object storage service, Amazon Simple Storage Service or S3, which allows the unlimited storage of any type of file, like images in our example. These are the basic building blocks of our application. We will use Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring this solution, and we will also want to ensure that our application is scalable and fault tolerant. So I'm going to go ahead and add Amazon Elastic Load Balancing and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to this diagram. For security and identity, we will be using Amazon Identity and Access Management or IAM.
