Hello everyone. Good to see you're here and ready to learn. You're almost done with the course. Now that we've added a storage and database layer, the employee directory application is fully functional but we still have two more issues. The first issue is that we have no insight into how our application is performing and how it utilizes resources. So to fix this, we will start off the next lesson with a discussion of a monitoring tool called Amazon CloudWatch. After we understand what the demand for your application looks like, we'll address the second problem, scalability. You may find that your application demand isn't always constant. So in the last section of the course, you'll learn how to automate the process of adding resources as demand increases and reducing capacity as demand declines to reduce cost. You'll also learn how to deliver traffic and load balance across a changing amount of resources. Let's get started.
