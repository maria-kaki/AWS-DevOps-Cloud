It's time for your first hands-on exercise with AWS. Before you can begin building on AWS, you'll have to have an AWS account. For your first exercise, we ask that you create an account with AWS, verify that account, and then you'll set up some billing alerts. When you create an AWS account, you can then begin using the services, and a lot of different services offer a free tier. The free tier varies from service to service. All of the services we chose for this course do have a free tier where you can use resources for free for a limited amount of time. If you have an existing account that you are trying to use, there's a chance you won't qualify for the free tier and would incur costs for the exercises you complete in this course. So for this first exercise, it's pretty straightforward and we are building up to the more complex tasks involved with hosting our employee directory application. You'll create and confirm your new AWS account, log into that account, and then you'll explore how to do basic management tasks, like where to find your account information and how to change regions using the AWS Management Console. You also will set up a billing alert. Just in case you create a resource and forget to turn it off or delete it, you'll be notified that you have hit a certain threshold in the account for cost. That's it for now.
