To round out this week, it's time for an exercise. In this exercise, you'll be building out a custom VPC for your application. You'll then spin up an EC2 instance, place it in the network, and then connect to it to see your app. So you'll first create the VPC and then you'll create four subnets, two public, and two private. You'll then want to provide internet connectivity to your public subnets. To do this, you'll create an internet gateway and attach it to your VPC. You'll then need to create two custom route tables. The first will be a public route table where you will add a route to the internet gateway. You'll then associate it with your two public subnets. The second route table will be a private route table which will only have the local route and you'll associate it with your two private subnets. Next, you'll launch an instance hosting your application. When selecting the network for that instance you'll choose the VPC you just created and one of the public subnets to place it in. From there you'll access your application through the browser. Note that because the application isn't hooked up to a database you won't be able to actually interact with it yet. That's coming soon. Alright, have fun and if you get stuck a good rule of thumb is to go back five steps and make sure you've done the previous steps correctly. See you soon.
