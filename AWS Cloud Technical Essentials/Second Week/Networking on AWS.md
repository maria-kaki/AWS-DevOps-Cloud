# __
In a lesson you saw earlier, we launched an instance and connected to that instance over the internet but to launch this instance, we needed to select a network. How you configure this network or VPC is actually what helps enable internet traffic to flow into your application. You might be asking, Seph, how did we select a VPC when we haven't even built a VPC yet? You're right, we haven't built a VPC, but fortunately AWS creates VPCs for us in every region by default.

When we launched our EC2 instances earlier in the course we simply chose the default VPC. These default VPCs are meant to provide an easy way for you to get started with EC2 instances quickly and view your applications over the internet.

However, you have to be careful with what you put inside of these default VPCs, as those resources will be subject to well, the internet. And with internet access comes potential dangers. If we didn't select this default VPC, we would've needed to select a VPC that we custom-built. In this section of the course we'll focus on doing just that, building a custom VPC for our application that is more secure and provides more granular access to the internet than the default option we originally chose. While viewing this section, keep in mind that this information is geared towards EC2-related services. If you are using a different kind of compute, such as a lambda function, you might not need a network at all. However, that doesn't mean this isn't important. Networking on AWS is the basis of most architectures, so consider this information highly valuable. Coming up, we'll dive into some key VPC concepts, but for now, take some time to review the upcoming notes, which will cover some important networking basics that you should know before jumping into networking on AWS.
