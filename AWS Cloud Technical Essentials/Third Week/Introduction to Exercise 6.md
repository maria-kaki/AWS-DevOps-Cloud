Let's put your new database knowledge to use. So far, the employee directory application is operating on EC2 and you have already created the Amazon S3 bucket from which the application will read from and write to for the employee photos. But you aren't really able to test that out without the database also being in place since adding a new employee needs to store both employee photos and employee data, so let's fix that. In this upcoming exercise, you will create a DynamoDB table called employees and you will configure the table to store the employee id, First and last name, location, title, and badges. You will then open the application from the browser and attempt to add a new employee, edit the employee, and delete the employee. After each step, you'll verify that the data is being updated in DynamoDB using the AWS console. After you're done creating the table and populating it, you'll have a working app. The DynamoDB table you will use will be automatically scalable in highly available so there really isn't much to do for this exercise. Have fun.
