So far, you've learned about compute and networking on AWS. Time to move on to two other major categories, storage and databases. The employee directory application we are building out currently has a solid network in place using Amazon VPC and is being hosted on Amazon EC2. The only issue is the app doesn't really work yet because we haven't set up anywhere for it to store the employee information or the employee photos. We are going to go ahead and fix that. We will start off by learning about the different storage offerings AWS has and compare and contrast them. Then we will create an Amazon S3 bucket in our account that the Employee Directory App will use to store employee images. Then we will explore the different database services AWS has and there are a lot. Not to worry though we are focusing on two, Amazon Relational Database Service or RDS and Amazon DynamoDB. As always, take the quizzes and please take a good look at the readings that we have placed between the video lessons. There's a lot of extra information there that could be useful to you as you continue your journey with AWS.
