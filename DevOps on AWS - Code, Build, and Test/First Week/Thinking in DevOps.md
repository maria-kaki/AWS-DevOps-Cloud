Hi, I'm Alana. And this is Carlos. He's a developer. (typing) His job is to create new, interesting features and write code. When Carlos is done creating a new feature, (button clicking) he hands it over to Martha, (whooshing sound) in operations. (clicking) Martha takes care of building and deploying that code, (soft beeping) while Carlos starts creating another new feature. However, sometimes bad things happen. (whooshing sound) One time, one of (button clicking) Carlos' features, that worked fine in his (clinking sound) development environments, brought up new errors and issues in the production environment. (soft warning sound) It was up to Martha, once that code was deployed, (typing) to solve these errors that were caused by the new changes. This wasn't very fun for Martha, as she was now managing this asset that she had no part in creating. And because she doesn't know it as intimately, it takes longer for her to troubleshoot it. It's not fun for Carlos either, as he may feel like he's juggling this pending feature, as well as the new features (phones ringing) he has to create. (soft beeping) They both feel like there's a wall between their two teams, when ultimately they both want the same thing. (upbeat chiming) They want the code to be deployed with no issues. So, how do the developers and the operations teams work better together? Well, this very question is why DevOps is now so popular, and why it's turned into a buzzword that's getting everyone's attention, rightfully so. But unfortunately, with all the press, DevOps gets confused with a lot of other technical concepts. For example, some think that DevOps is synonymous with infrastructure as code, or the same thing as Agile, or it's just automated testing and delivery. But really, what is DevOps? DevOps is a way for the development teams and the operations teams to work better together, and ultimately share the responsibility for the software they build. DevOps is just a bridge over the gap between development and operations. And DevOps isn't any one of these technologies, it's really more of a cultural shift in thinking. For example, with Carlos and Martha, they need to increase their collaboration, transparency, and their communication. They'll also both be taking on responsibilities outside the scope of their current position, Martha taking responsibilities on the development side, and Carlos taking responsibilities on the operations side. As they work to bridge the gap, they'll need clear expectations on both sides, and to define who does what, and how they'll work together. All of that is cultural. That being said, the cultural shift in thinking is only half the equation. The other half is the tooling, this is where things like Agile, and infrastructure as code, and automated test and delivery come into play. The idea is that you take the application of engineering practices and tools and apply them to operations tasks. In turn, this should help you deliver applications and services faster, and at a higher quality. There are a few key tools and practices that are becoming more and more common. The first is the idea of making things smaller. For example, a common practice is to perform very frequent, but small updates to an application. This practice leads to significantly more deployments, with each deployment being less risky. That's because when things are small, it's easier to troubleshoot, identify issues, and in general, you have a smaller, external impact. The second concept is to automate everything. This helps keep computing resources elastic and responsive to those frequent changes. And if you make a mistake, you can very quickly go back and reliably reproduce the previous state. And then the last one I'll talk about is practicing continuous integration and continuous delivery. Often, when you're moving very quickly, there are new operational issues you have to solve. It's true, you want to deploy quickly, but you also want to deploy in a safe and gradual manner. That's what CI/CD is all about, and we'll talk at length about this throughout the series of courses.

Now, with the cultural shift side of things and the tooling you need to achieve DevOps, it's not just a one-time process that you set up at the beginning and it will always work. It's a continuous practice, and to showcase this, technologists often use an infinity loop to represent all the steps of the lifecycle, and how they relate to one another. As you can see, what's needed for development is on the left side of the loop, and what's needed for operations is on the right side of the loop. They're combined, and you can't have one without the other. If you'd like to learn more about this culture, and some of the core practices, check out the resources that are posted for the end of this week. You'll also learn some of the key components of DevOps throughout the next few weeks. Stay tuned.
