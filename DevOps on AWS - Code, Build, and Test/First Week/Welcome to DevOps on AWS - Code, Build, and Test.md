The course that will talk about the Code, Build and Test parts of the DevOps workflow. My name is Rafael Lopes, but you can call me Raf, and I will be one of your instructors for this course. Russ and Alana will also join the party with videos, screen captures, virtual whiteboards, and hands-on activities. I'm pretty sure it will be fun for you to watch as it was for us to create and record this content for you. If you work on writing software that gets in front of customers and want to get a better understanding on how to apply some DevOps practice to your current workloads, this course is for you. You will explore AWS services that will help your application delivery like AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodePipeline. When developing code, we always have to ask ourselves questions, such as:

Are the current practices quickly getting stable, innovative software in front of your customers?

And can we leverage DevOps automation to gain the competitive advantage that comes from better workflows?

We know that software is a critical component for many organizations that want to optimize their products and solutions by reducing time to market and create more robust code. Adopting the culture of automation is the key to achieve that.

So, in this first course of the DevOps series, 
![[Pasted image 20230708221122.png]]
we will focus on the Code, Build, and Test aspects of the DevOps operation.

We will get into topics like source control, best practice for continuous integration, and how to use the right tools to measure code quality by identifying workflow steps that could be automated. With automation comes confidence, and with confidence comes the optimization of time-consuming processes, resulting in better quality software that can be built faster. Join me, Alana, and Russ for the first course of the DevOps on AWS series on this platform. Let's talk about Code, Build, and Test.
