The most important thing we covered here, is the philosophy and practice of DevOps automation. Hopefully, we have equipped you with the knowledge you need to make some decisions about the philosophy and practice in your own organizations. Investing your time in automation results in better work and better software for everyone involved. DevOps itself isn't really intended to be prescriptive. You will make the decision of where to best invest in process improvements and the tools that are right for your team. Remember, DevOps teaches us to move away from siloed teams. Maybe your role has traditionally never had to think about deployments or security. Moving out of these silos can only expose you to a more varied and fulfilling role, developing new skills and sharing your skills with others. I hope to see you in the future courses where we will focus on applying these DevOps practices to the unending steps of release, deploy, operation, and monitoring of your software. Stay tuned for the other DevOps courses as part of this series. On behalf of Alana and Russ, thank you for watching our content so far. See you soon.
