Currently, we have a build in our local environment. Now, it's time to run exactly the same build inside of CodeBuild. We'll create a buildspec file that contains the same tests we are performing in the local build, linting with Pylint, and unit tests with pytest. We'll then commit the buildspec file to the CodeCommit repository. With this in place, we can configure a CodeBuild build project. The CodeBuild build project needs to know where the source code is, in this case, your CodeCommit repository, and the environment where your build will run. For this, we will use the Ubuntu image managed by CodeBuild. We won't configure an artifact for this project, as we are just running tests. We'll simply start a build, and see the output from build logging as it happens. When the build completes, we can see the reports that are generated from the output for unit test and code coverage. So, let's get started with Exercise 3.
