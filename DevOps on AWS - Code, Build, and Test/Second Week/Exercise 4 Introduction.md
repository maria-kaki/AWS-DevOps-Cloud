It's time for you to build your own continuous integration pipeline. In the previous exercise, you created a CodeBuild project to run tests, but with everything you learned so far, you determined that the right thing to do is to run tests for every code push. In this exercise, you will create a pipeline with a source action, which in this case will be CodeCommit followed by the tests powered by CodeBuild. Starting with the commit and the push to the Dev environments, you will create a feature branch in your AWS CodeCommit repository. This branch will be called feature-bonus-scores. Then, you will edit the code to implement a bonus score feature. The change will be made in the new branch that you created. And after that, your application will now have a feature that will have bonus points for the questions in the trivia app.

When the code is ready to go, you will create a pull request to the CodeCommit repository. That pull request will allow other team members to have the chance to comment on that change before it gets merged. Once the pull request is approved, the merge will get created. All right! Now, it is your turn to get hands on and try it out on the application's first pull request. If this is the last exercise you were doing as part of this course, don't forget to delete all the lab resources as indicated on the very last instruction of the exercise.
