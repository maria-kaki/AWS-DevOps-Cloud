In the last video, we talked about change monitoring with AWS Config, which is an AWS service that allows you to take actions, based on infrastructure changes. In this video, I would like to talk about AWS CloudTrail, an AWS service that also operates on that scope, but in a more granular way. As the name suggests, CloudTrail gives you a trail of API actions, made to an AWS account, giving you visibility into user and resource activity. CloudTrail is enabled by default in every AWS account, and saves AWS API activity into an Amazon S3 bucket, in the form of compressed text files. Did someone create a new instance in your account? CloudTrail stores that. A security group rule was changed, opening a firewall port? CloudTrail logs that. A modification in the CodePipeline configuration, it's also captured by CloudTrail. It logs API activity for API calls, made to an AWS account, with the corresponding response from the service, no matter if it was successful or not. So, what's the difference between AWS Config and AWS CloudTrail? It's simple. While AWS Config gives you the infrastructure delta, AWS CloudTrail will give you the evidence. The specific API call that was used in order to make that change, which is instrumental for forensics, security analysis, and troubleshooting. In addition, at this point, you should be embracing automations, like the start of CodePipeline upon push into CodeCommit to make changes in your environment. The more automation you have, the more the S3 bucket, used by CloudTrail, will be populated. A good practice is to use data visualization tools, to visualize the API calls made to your AWS account. That leaves a bit from the DevOps area, and enters a little bit more into the data analytics one. But the thing is, once you already have that solution, navigating through the CloudTrail data, is way easier than having to manually parse, compressed, text files in a bucket. I recommend having some sort of data visualization solution, on top of CloudTrail data. There are plenty of tutorials around on how to do that, and even a short course made by us, here in this platform. I will put more details into the course notes.

That's it. And remember that when something changes, in your AWS environment, AWS Config gives you the delta, AWS CloudTrail gives you the evidence. Stay safe.
