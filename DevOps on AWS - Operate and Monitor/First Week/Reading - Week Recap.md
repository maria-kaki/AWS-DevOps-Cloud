During the first week of the third course on the DevOps Series, you have learned what is the Monitoring value proposition and why instrumenting your environments is helpful.

The week’s content was divided into Cloud, Application and Networking environments, with the corresponding AWS Services to apply monitoring to give you insights on what’s going on with your Cloud environments. The instructors covered services and features such as CloudWatch Metrics, Alarms and Logs, in addition to VPC Flow Logs, AWS X-Ray, Amazon EventBridge, AWS Config and AWS CloudTrail.

At the end of the week, we offered an optional hands-on exercise, where you may have learned about topics and best-practices you can perform in your own environments. The exercise covered how to be notified when the CodePipeline status changes, which could be instrumental for posting a message into a chat room in case of the pipeline getting stuck!

You are almost there! Please continue your DevOps journey towards the next and last week of the DevOps on AWS Series, the week where we will cover Operations and AWS Systems Manager in depth!
