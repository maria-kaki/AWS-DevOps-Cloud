All right, so you got it working. The CI/CD is working well, and everything seems to operate like a well-oiled machine, meaning that you have fail-safe mechanisms to push things to production, whenever needed. But, is that everything you need, in order to have a real smooth operation? From that stage on, your application has graduated to production, which means it has its doors open to the public. Operating a public-facing infrastructure without monitoring is similar to flying an airplane without instruments. And that's totally not where you want to be.

The big question is, how would you know how your systems are performing for the real world? Well, to answer that, I personally like to catalog metrics into three major categories, which are environment metrics, application metrics, and network metrics. Let's just start with the first, environment metrics, which are metrics that refer to the environments the application is running, such as CPU and memory utilization, disk space, number of read I/Os, number of write I/Os in your database, and operational things that help you to detect architectural bottlenecks, and do optimizations. I also include here, the monitoring of operations made by the DevOps team to the environments, such as the states of the CI/CD pipeline, configuration changes, and logging about everything that was made in the environment.

Another major monitoring category, are application metrics, like how much time those specific routines take to complete? Or what routines are more expensive in terms of compute, or memory resources? That would be helpful to find slow queries or prioritize code refactoring, to make things run faster and cheaper. These metrics could be interesting for developers to troubleshoot issues on the code, or product managers to strategize what parts to refactor first. For application metrics, you can count them with the help of AWS X-Ray and CloudWatch custom metrics. These services also allow working with business-related metrics, such as the number of active users per hour, how much time each user spends in the platform, and useful insights for business stakeholders. Last, but not least, network metrics. As the name suggests, these are focused on networking. When I say networking, I refer to things like latency measurements, packets per second, and networking aspects of the operation. This is very valuable, especially if you are developing applications, mostly consumed by mobile phones. I say that because your users will be using their internet connections to access your endpoints. And because that's something out of your control most times, monitoring is even more instrumental. Network monitoring is also relevant if you have clusters, and lots of internal communication between your servers.

If your resources are sitting in the VPC-- like, EC2 instances and RDS databases-- you can leverage AWS managed services like VPC Flow Logs, in order to have digested information about your networking activity. There are so many options, and I don't want to give you spoilers of what you were about to learn in this course. Among all of those options, the last thing you need is to worry. You are in the right course if you came here to learn about AWS, and how to monitor things. Alana and I will talk about the AWS services and ideas that can help you to tackle each one of those monitoring areas. Ready to start? I am.
