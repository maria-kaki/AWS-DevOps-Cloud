As I said earlier, AWS Systems Manager is a suite of features that you can embrace for the operation parts of your DevOps journey. In this video, I will be talking about some Systems Manager features that can be useful for you, regardless of whether you have serverless or EC2 based architectures. In this video, I will cover some relevant features of Systems Manager, a vast AWS service with many other features. I will talk about Parameter Store, Change Manager, and shared resources.
# __
Let's start with Parameter Store. Parameter Store provides a secure way to store data in a key-value fashion. It is ideal for storing things like passwords, database strings, Amazon Machine Image-- or AMI--IDs to be used by your automation solution, license codes, serial numbers, or any key-value data that you would like to programmatically store and retrieve in an encrypted way. For example, if you store a database connection string in Parameter Store, your application backend can get them by doing API calls instead of having them hardcoded. By doing this, you turn connection strings into something detached from your code, preventing you from having to do deployments if you change them. Same thing with passwords.

Many customers need to comply with password or credentials rotation. This is also easier to achieve with Parameter Store because you can simply change the value in there and code your application in a way to query Parameter Store again in case of authentication failure, forcing some sort of automatic refresh. Parameter Store is also accessible from other AWS services, including, but not limited to, AWS Lambda, CloudFormation, and offloading credentials and sensitive information from Lambda code or a CloudFormation template is always a good idea, especially if you're publishing it somewhere. Another Systems Manager feature that I would like to highlight is the Change Manager, which is instrumental, especially if you're using multiple AWS accounts and would like to track what's being changed on them. Change Manager simplifies the way Ops engineers track, approve, and implement operational changes to their application configurations and environments. Think about using Change Manager when you want Ops to request some sort of elevation in terms of access, in order to do something in your account. To use it, you need to create templates, which are a collection of automation runbooks for a user to choose from when creating a change request, SNS topics for notifying approvers about the change, and CloudWatch alarms to monitor the runbook workflow. When a change is needed, someone in the organization creates a change request that must be based in one of the available templates you create. If the change requires manual approvals, Change Manager notifies the designated approvers.

Now, an interesting thing to observe regarding Change Manager and CI/CD for releasing code. Change Manager should complement the safety controls of your CI/CD practices. But if you're doing CI/CD for your daily code releases, asking for approval every time may slow down your operational speed, especially for the dev environment. That's why I recommend using Change Manager only for things other than the usual code release, such as the creation of new AWS accounts in your organization, or launching instance types that cost more than the instance types the application usually needs. Things like that.

Now, last but not least, AWS Systems Manager shared resources, also known as AWS SSM documents. An AWS Systems Manager document defines the actions that System Manager performs in your account. Think about a repository of actions that can be taken, where these actions are automations, which are very helpful for taking immediate response at a click of a button.

Once you navigate through the Documents part of Systems Manager, you will see a repository of actions that were pre-made by AWS. Such as this one, for example, called AWS-CloseSecurityGroup. If you click on it, you can see a description of what it does. This one removes any rules from a specified security group. You just need to provide the security group ID, and it does it for you. Here, you can also see what are the permissions needed to do that. By clicking Execute automation, I can provide the security group ID and the IAM role that will be assumed by this automation. If I scroll down, the page gives me the CLI commands that correspond to that action, facilitating the creation of a script to do that. I can also provide multiple security group IDs and execute this automation gradually, or by doing one target at a time. Take a look at the Documents section in your AWS Systems Manager console, and imagine what you can do with it right now in your account. There are many interesting blueprints, like enabling S3 bucket logging, attaching IAM roles to specific instances, and much more.

You can treat these as small component, part of something bigger, or perhaps an approval workflow from a Change Manager template.
