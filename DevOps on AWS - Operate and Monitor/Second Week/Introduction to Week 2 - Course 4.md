In the second week of this course, I will be covering aspects regarding the operational part of your environments.

An important aspect of the DevOps workflow is to know that a continuum must be made. That's where the term continuous integration and continuous delivery comes from. A continuum means that the workflow acts as an infinite loop. And in order for that to smoothly succeed, you must think about things that would allow the loop to be completed. Otherwise, it's not a loop, but a dead end. What I mean here is that you need to think about things that will not interrupt the DevOps workflow. And AWS offers a suite of services that you can use to facilitate that. In this week of the course, I will be talking about the AWS services that will help you operationalize your infrastructure. What I mean by operationalize is having your infrastructure operating in a uniform and compliant state.

For example, there is a service called AWS Systems Manager that helps a lot with that task, and we will be covering some of the core aspects of it. I will also be talking about CloudFormation best practices.

At the end of the week, you will do a hands-on exercise using a feature of AWS Systems Manager called Run Command to troubleshoot production issues. Ready to start operationalizing everything? Stay tuned.
