Though AWS offers you a suite of services for DevOps operations and monitoring, third-party, open-source tooling is also well known and widely used by the DevOps community. The following list describes some of the most common open-source DevOps tooling available. In addition, both Puppet and Ansible are members of the AWS Partner Network (APN). There are also many other very good tooling and services for DevOps operations available! [**Puppet**](http://puppet.com/) Puppet is an infrastructure automation and delivery tool. Puppet is also responsible for publishing one of the most important research papers in the DevOps industry—the famous “State of DevOps” paper, which can be found here: [State of DevOps Report 2021 | Puppet](https://puppet.com/resources/report/2021-state-of-devops-report/). [**Jenkins**](https://www.jenkins.io/) Jenkins is an open-source automation server. Jenkins provides many plugins to support building, deploying, and automating any project. It’s common to have Jenkins working together with AWS CodePipeline because they developed a [plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/aws-codepipeline/) that works with CodePipeline. For more information, see: [Setting up a CI/CD pipeline by integrating Jenkins with AWS CodeBuild and AWS CodeDeploy | AWS DevOps Blog (amazon.com)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/setting-up-a-ci-cd-pipeline-by-integrating-jenkins-with-aws-codebuild-and-aws-codedeploy/) [**Ansible**](https://www.ansible.com/) Ansible, which is sponsored by Red Hat, is also used for IT automation. Although this course focuses on AWS products and services, being familiar with open-source solutions can be helpful, especially when you need a multi-cloud solution. When you plan your DevOps operations, it’s important to evaluate what AWS solutions and third-party tools make sense as part of your pipeline.
