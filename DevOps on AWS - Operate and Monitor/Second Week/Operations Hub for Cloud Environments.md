With that many options for operating your cloud infrastructure, you may be asking: Is there any place where I can gain centralized operational insights and take actions on AWS resources? 
![[Pasted image 20230708212534.png]]
The answer for that question is AWS Systems Manager. AWS Systems Manager is an AWS service that you can use to view and control your infrastructure on AWS. You can view operational data from multiple AWS services and automate operational tasks across them. It helps you to maintain the security and compliance by scanning your instances and reporting, or even better, taking corrective action on any policy violation it detects. AWS Systems Manager is a must-have if you have a fleet of EC2 instances, because it helps you on the burden of fleet management. You can group your instances together and run commands on them all at the same time, or one by one. You can also securely connect to an instance, to have an interactive shell without having to use SSH, logging all the commands and outputs in the CloudWatch Logs log stream. But it does not stop there. You can also so use the SSM for your serverless operation, build health dashboards for your resources, securely store parameters used by your application, publish messages for incident response, build response plans, and even enable your teams to interact with chatbots or escalation points during crisis. There are so many things to learn about AWS Systems Manager that I wish I had all the time in the world to create endless videos for you. But I will do my best to take care of your time, and because less is more, I will only focus on the core features. But don't forget to read the course notes as well, because I will add more detailed information in there about this fantastic world called AWS Systems Manager. So in the next videos, I will be talking about AWS SSM general features, and also drilling down a bit on separate operational parts of it. Let's go.
