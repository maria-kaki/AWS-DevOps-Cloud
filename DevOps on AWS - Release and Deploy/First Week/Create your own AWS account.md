As part of this course, there are hands-on exercises where you will have the opportunity to use and explore a variety of AWS services. To work on the hands-on exercises, you must have your own AWS account. If you don’t already have an AWS account, see the following section for more information about how to get started. **Important**: Not all hands-on exercises are designed to run within the AWS Free Tier. Some hands-on exercises might have a cost associated with them. Check the [AWS pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) to determine the cost of the referenced AWS services.
