In the last exercise, you got an EC2 instance up and running with a CodeDeploy agent installed. You also created two IAM roles, one for the CodeDeploy service, and one for EC2 to communicate with S3. In this exercise, we take this a step further. You'll first create the S3 bucket where you'll upload your application code. We'll be providing you this code in a .zip file format. And if you open up the .zip file, you'll see you have a few different files. The first is an HTML file, which contains the application you'll be using, which, in this case, is just a static site that looks like a blog. This index.html file is what you'll be hosting on your EC2 instance. We also provide you with an AppSpec file. CodeDeploy will use this file to install the application dependencies, and start and stop the server using scripts that we've created in the scripts folder of the .zip file. Once you have your code uploaded to S3, you'll set up an application and a deployment group in CodeDeploy. You'll then create a deployment that ships the code to the instance. After you see that your application works as expected, you'll change the code in any way you'd like, whether you change the color of an element, or the text of the website, or both. And then, you'll create another deployment shipping out these revisions to your EC2 instance. You'll confirm the changes were made by viewing them on the instance, and then you'll be done with the lab. Remember, if you have any questions, you can seek help from one another or from the instructors in the forums or discussion groups. Happy learning!
