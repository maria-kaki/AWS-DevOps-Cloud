Congratulations on completing, and thank you for taking this course. We covered a lot of topics. In the first week, we covered continuous delivery and some of the tools that help us achieve it, like CodeDeploy. You went in-depth with this service, learning how to deploy to an EC2 instance manually and how to automate that deployment using CodePipeline. - [Raf] In the second week, we learned how to automate our environment and our pipeline further, using infrastructure as code. We focused on the CloudFormation service, giving you an overview of the service, how it can help in the pipeline automation, and how to troubleshoot when things go wrong. At this point, you should feel pretty comfortable with all aspects of a CI/CD pipeline and the AWS services that can help enabling CI/CD. So you may be asking yourself, where do I go from here? Well, there is another course in this series, where we cover monitoring and operation aspects for every single step involved in your pipeline, from the application to the network and the AWS services you use all the way to monitoring the pipeline itself. For all things monitoring and observability, feel free to continue on the next course in this series. - [Alana] On behalf of Russ, Raf, and I, thank you for taking this course. We hope you've learned some new things and enjoyed our time together. - [Raf] We hope to see you in the next course. See you soon.
